        <p>
          Web Dev is a super cool and ever-changing field where you get to
          create and maintain websites and web applications. Think about it: the
          internet is where we chat, shop, and share information—it's a big
          deal! So, as a web developer, you'll use your coding, design, and
          problem-solving skills to make awesome stuff happen online. You'll be
          the one bringing ideas to life and making websites that people love to
          use. It's a wild and exciting ride in the digital world!
        </p>

        <p>
          The core technologies that live in its heart are HTML (Hyper Text
          Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JS (JavaScript).
          Web developers skillfully employ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as
          esemplastic tools, molding and shaping the digital landscape to create
          visually captivating and interactive websites and web applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          But before diving into these technologies, lets look at the big
          picture. Watch
          <a href="https://youtu.be/hJHvdBlSxug" target="_blank"
            >Academind's Video&nearr;</a
          >
          to learn how the web works.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that you have a general understanding of what is going on, let's
          dive into web dev! You know that webpages are constructed with HTML,
          CSS and JavaScript, but what do they specifically do?
        </p>

        <h2 class="element1">HTML-- Hyper Text Markup Language</h2>

        <p>
          HTML is like the backbone of the internet. It's the language that
          makes websites happen. With HTML, you get to structure and organize
          web content, making it all neat and tidy. It's a bit like creating a
          blueprint for a website, where you decide how things should be laid
          out.
        </p>

        <p>
          HTML works with two fundamental blocks-- tags and elements. Tags are
          represented by angular brackets (&lt; &gt;) and elements go in between
          the tags, some elements include paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), images
          (&lt;img&gt;), and many more. You might be wondering where the content
          goes. Most of the elements provide a closing tag to help you enclose
          the content within the opening and closing tags. For example, the
          content for a paragraph goes in between the opening tag (&lt;p&gt;)
          and its closing counterpart (&lt;/p&gt;).
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, we know that you can make a website's layout using HTML's tags
          and elements, but have you wondered what sort of technology helps
          browsers understand HTML? It's the DOM- Document Object Model! Watch
          this quick
          <a href="https://youtu.be/i_T33FSl254" target="_blank"
            >video by Scott&nearr;</a
          >
          where he explains the DOM and how it powers our HTML.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ready for your first task? Per Borgen has designed an interactive
          learning platform, which he calls Scrimba. Your first task is to
          complete
          <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlandcss" target="_blank"
            >the first module&nearr;</a
          >
          and get familiar with HTML. It will roughly take you an hour to
          complete it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="element1" target="_blank">CSS- Cascading Style Sheets</h2>

        <p>
          Let's talk about CSS, the fashion designer for web pages. Imagine you
          have an HTML skeleton for your web page – the structure is there, but
          it looks plain and boring. That's where CSS swoops in! You can use CSS
          to add colors, choose funky fonts, create eye-catching layouts, and
          make things look super slick and polished.
        </p>

        <p>
          CSS works by applying styles to HTML elements, like giving a div a
          cool background color, or making text look like it's popping off the
          screen with drop shadows. You can even go wild and make elements move,
          spin, or fade in and out - it's like having the power to bring your
          web page to life!
        </p>

        <p>
          The beauty of CSS is that it's all about control and flexibility. You
          can create rules that apply to specific elements or groups of
          elements, making it easy to maintain a consistent look throughout your
          website. So, whether you want to create a sleek corporate site or a
          funky personal blog, CSS is your trusty sidekick that helps you bring
          your unique style to the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          CSS can get pretty rough quick. That is why Odysseus recommends you
          the
          <a
            href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations"
            target="_blank"
            >Odin Project's resources for CSS&nearr;</a
          >. Please complete the CSS Foundations and the FlexBox modules to get
          an in-depth understanding of CSS and responsive design.
        </p>

        <h2 class="element1">Project-- Static Webpage</h2>

        <p>
          Now that you have an in depth understanding of HTML and CSS, try to
          make a simple static webpage. It could be a study planner, event
          countdown, personal finance tracker, or a recipe collection. You name
          it. Odysseus recommends you to use AI tools like chatGPT or Bard to
          get ideas, user interfaces, or anything as long as you code every line
          of the necessary HTML and CSS yourself.
        </p>

        <h2 class="element1">JavaScript</h2>

        <p>
          Now that you are capable of making a static webpage, let's understand
          how to add functionalities to your webpages. JavaScript is used to
          manipulate the DOM, and make things work. Consider a button. You might
          have noticed, your button does not do anything when you click on it.
          Javascript helps you make the button function and respond to events,
          such as changing colors when you hover on it, open google when you
          click on it and so on. Complete
          <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript" target="_blank">
            Scrimba's JS course&nearr;
          </a>
          to understand and get familiar with the notion of DOM manipulation and
          JS syntax. The course is about 10 hours long.
        </p>

        <h2 class="element1">Project--JavaScript</h2>

        <p>
          You have realized how important javascript is to web developers. Now
          is your turn to make a project out of this language. Odysseus suggests
          this
          <a

          nutshell is code and special tools written by other developers to help
          you.
        </p>

        <h2 class="element1">Front End Frameworks</h2>

        <p>
          Front-end frameworks are like your trusty sidekicks in the world of
          web development. They're like a toolbox filled with handy tools that
          help you build beautiful and interactive user interfaces with ease.

        <p>
          Back-end frameworks are like the powerful engines behind the scenes of
          a website or web application. They handle the heavy lifting, data
          processing, and server-side magic that make things work smoothly.
          These frameworks, such as Express.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails,
          provide a solid foundation for building robust and scalable back-end
          systems. With their collection of tools, libraries, and conventions,
          they make it easier to handle complex tasks like routing, database
          integration, authentication, and API development. Back-end frameworks
          allow developers to focus on the logic and functionality that powers
          the application, without getting lost in the intricacies of low-level
          server programming. So, whether you're building an e-commerce platform
          or a social networking site, back-end frameworks have got your back,
          enabling you to create powerful, secure, and dynamic web applications
          that can handle whatever demands are thrown their way.
        </p>

        <h3>Node.js - Express</h3>
        <p>
          Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime that allows developers to
          run JavaScript code on the server-side. It was created in 2009 to
          unify web development by using JavaScript for both front-end and
          back-end tasks. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture enables

          development. It's an open-source web application framework written in
          Ruby that brings elegance and productivity to building web
          applications. With Rails, you can say goodbye to repetitive tasks and
          hello to rapid development. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
          architectural pattern, providing a logical structure for organizing
          your code. Rails embraces the concept of convention over
          configuration, which means it comes with sensible defaults and
          predefined conventions that make development a breeze. It boasts a
          vast ecosystem of gems (libraries) that extend its functionality and
          allow you to add features with just a few lines of code. Whether
          you're building a social network, an e-commerce platform, or a content
          management system, Ruby on Rails is here to amplify your web
