        <h1>Web Development</h1>

        <p>
          Web Dev is a super cool and ever-changing field where you get to
          create and maintain websites and web applications. Think about it: the
          internet is where we chat, shop, and share informationâ€”it's a big
          deal! So, as a web developer, you'll use your coding, design, and
          problem-solving skills to make awesome stuff happen online. You'll be
          the one bringing ideas to life and making websites that people love to
          use. It's a wild and exciting ride in the digital world!
        </p>

        <p>
          The core technologies that live in its heart are HTML (Hyper Text
          Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JS (JavaScript).
          Web developers skillfully employ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as
          esemplastic tools, molding and shaping the digital landscape to create
          visually captivating and interactive websites and web applications.

        <p>
          But before diving into these technologies, lets look at the big
          picture. Watch
          <a href="https://youtu.be/hJHvdBlSxug">Academind's Video&nearr;</a> to
          learn how the web works.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that you have a general understanding of what is going on, let's
          dive into web dev! You know that webpages are constructed with HTML,
          CSS and JavaScript, but what are they?
        </p>

        <h2>HTML-- Hyper Text Markup Language</h2>

        <p>
          HTML is like the backbone of the internet. It's the language that
          makes websites happen. With HTML, you get to structure and organize
          web content, making it all neat and tidy. It's a bit like creating a
          blueprint for a website, where you decide how things should be laid
          out.
        </p>

        <p>
          HTML works with two fundamental blocks-- tags and elements. Tags are
          represented by angular brackets (&lt; &gt;) and elements go in between
          the tags, some elements include paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), images
          (&lt;img&gt;), and many more. You might be wondering where the content
          goes. Most of the elements provide a closing tag to help you enclose
          the content within the opening and closing tags. For example, the
          content for a paragraph goes in between the opening tag (&lt;p&gt;)
          and its closing counterpart (&lt;/p&gt;).
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, we know that you can make a website's layout using HTML's tags
          and elements, but have you wondered what sort of technology helps
          browsers understand HTML? It's the DOM- Document Object Model! Watch
          this quick
          <a href="https://youtu.be/i_T33FSl254">video by Scott&nearr;</a> where
          he explains the DOM and how it powers our HTML.
        </p>

          learning platform, which he calls Scrimba. Your first task is to
          complete

          and get familiar with HTML. It will roughly take you an hour to
          complete it.
