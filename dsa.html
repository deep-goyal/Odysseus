        <p>
          We are here. This is going to be a life defining moment for you. Now
          that you are comfortable with a programming language, in this section,
          you will learn how to manipulate data and perform tasks to solve
          problems, the real life kind. Your first task here is to get a general
          understanding of this section. Thankfully, Tren has published a
          <a href="https://youtu.be/oz9cEqFynHU">stunning video&nearr;</a> to
          help you out here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your strategy here is simple. You have to learn data structures and
          algorithms by referring to
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/?redirectFromSmile=1"
            >Steven Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual&nearr;</a
          >
          and solving a whole lot of
          <a href="https://leetcode.com">LeetCode&nearr;</a> problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dr. Skiena proves to have an acute interest and a unique way to
          approach a problem logically in his book. If you ever feel the need
          for other resources, here are my recommendations --
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCode">
            NeetCode's Youtube Lectures&nearr;
          </a>
          and
          <a href="http://timroughgarden.org/videos.html"
            >Tim RoughGarden's Lectures&nearr;</a
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login">ChatGPT&nearr;</a> might
          be helpful in learning new data structures and finding the code syntax
          instantly too. I would recommend using whatever resources you can to
          solve the problems, the aim here is to understand how to logically
          break down a problem into smaller chunks and dealing with each of them
          algorithmically.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are done, congratulations! We are moving to an exciting part of
          this learning track--Web Development.
