        <h2>Let's setup your work environment.</h2>

        <p>
          Every programmer uses what's called an IDE, short for Integrated
          Development Environment, to write code. Its a fancy notepad so to
          speak. IDEs give you some of the best tools to write code. It includes
          syntax highlighting, auto-formatting, and much more. A few popular
          IDEs are VS Code, Eclipse, intelliJ, and XCode. Odysseus requires you
          to use Visual Studio Code.
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download"
            >Download VS Code&nearr;</a
          >
          and follow
          <a href="https://youtu.be/B-s71n0dHUk">this tutorial.&nearr;</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          Special note, I would love to suggest you the Prettier extension for
          VS Code. Prettier automatically formats your code.
          <a href="https://youtu.be/8k-b-7rJAeU">Here&nearr;</a> is how you can
          set it up in your desktop.
        </p>

        <h2>Command Line Interface and the Bourne Again SHell (BASH)</h2>

        <p>
          Now that you have a clean setup, lets also get used to the command
          line, an interface that you will inevitably use quite often. The
          Software Carpentry's
          <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/"
            >Unix Shell Document&nearr;</a
          >
          provides a comprehensive introduction to the language. I would suggest
          reading the chapters 1-4, until you are familiar with pipers and
          filters. I would also suggest watching this
          <a href="https://youtu.be/I4EWvMFj37g">video&nearr;</a> about BASH
          once you are familiar with the command line, and how to use the shell
          in general. One thing to note, BASH and command line are not the same
          thing. Command line is just a text based interface, and BASH is a
          shell that provides this interface and many other scripting tools that
          you can leverage to run your programs efficiently.

        <p>
          Pheww. That was a lot of effort. I commend you for keeping up
          &#128513; Now, lets get started with programming.
        </p>

        <h2>What is programming?</h2>

        <p>
          Programming is the art of creating instructions, known as code, that
          computers can understand and execute. It's like speaking a special
          language to communicate with our electronic friends. We use
          programming languages like C, Java, or Python to write logical and
          structured commands that solve problems and perform tasks. Programmers
          are like puzzle solvers! They break down complex problems into
          smaller, manageable steps, using their creativity and logical
          thinking. It's a bit like following a recipe or solving a puzzle, but
          with a tech twist! After we write our code, it goes through a
          fascinating transformation. First, it's translated into assembly code,
          which is a more readable version for computers. Then, it's further
          translated into machine code—instructions that the computer's hardware
          can directly understand. Finally, it becomes a binary executable—the
          ultimate language that our computer loves! Programming is more than
          just automation and data manipulation; it's a versatile skill that
          opens up a world of possibilities. With programming, we can automate
          tasks, manipulate data, build software applications, and much more. It
          requires practice and attention to detail, allowing us to harness the
          power of computers to accomplish various goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is your first task. You have to learn a general purpose
          programming language. It could be C, C++, Python, or Java. The aim
          here is to get familiar with the notion of specific instructions and
          how a computer processes these instructions. My recommendation is
          <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/">Harvard's CS50&nearr;</a>
          to learn C and Python. You can stop watching their lectures once you
          are familiar with Python. Odysseus has a better path for web
          development later down the line.

        <h2>Project Time!</h2>

        <p>
          Now that you have a great general-purpose programming language under
          your belt, its time to get your hands dirty. Your next task is to
          complete one project based on the language you have learnt. Create a
          new repo in your GitHub, and clone it in your VS Code. Luckily, there
          is a great

            href="https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning"

          >
          that you can leverage for ideas. It goes without saying, you can
          always showcase your project or get ideas in Odysseus' official
