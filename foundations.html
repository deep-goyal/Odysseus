        <h2>Let's setup your work environment.</h2>

        <p>
          Every programmer uses what's called an IDE, short for Integrated
          Development Environment. Its a fancy notepad so to speak. IDEs give
          you some of the best tools to write code. Some of them include syntax
          highlighting, autoformatting, and much more. A few popular IDEs are VS
          Code, Eclipse, intelliJ, and XCode. Odysseus requires you to use
          Visual Studio Code.
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Download VS Code</a>
          and follow <a href="https://youtu.be/B-s71n0dHUk">this</a> tutorial.
        </p>

        <p>
          Special note, I would love to suggest you the Prettier extension for
          VS Code. Prettier automatically formats your code.
          <a href="https://youtu.be/8k-b-7rJAeU">Here</a> is how you can set it
          up in your desktop.
        </p>

        <h2>Command Line Interface and the Bourne Again SHell (BASH)</h2>

        <p>
          Now that you have a clean setup, lets also get used to the command
          line, a tool that you will inevitably use quite often. The Software
          Carpentry's
          <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/"
            >Unix Shell Document</a
          >
          provides a comprehensive introduction to the language. I would suggest
          reading the chapters 1-4, until you are familiar with pipers and
          filters. I would also suggest watching this
          <a href="https://youtu.be/I4EWvMFj37g">video</a> about BASH once you
          are familiar with the command line, and how to use the shell in
          general. One thing to note, BASH and command line are not the same
          thing. Command line is just a text based interface, and BASH is a
          shell that provides this interface and many other scripting tools that
          you can leverage to run your programs effectively.

        <h2>GIT- The Ultimate Save Button</h2>

        <p>
          You are going to be writing a lot of code soon, but how are you going
          to manage it? That's where Git and GitHub enter the picture. Go

        <p>Pheww. That was a lot of effort and good job keeping up!</p>

        <h2>What is programming?</h2>

        <p>
          Programming is the art of creating instructions, known as code, that
          computers can understand and execute. It's like speaking a special
          language to communicate with our electronic friends. We use
          programming languages like C, Java, or Python to write logical and
          structured commands that solve problems and perform tasks. Programmers
          are like puzzle solvers! They break down complex problems into
          smaller, manageable steps, using their creativity and logical
          thinking. It's a bit like following a recipe or solving a puzzle, but
          with a tech twist! After we write our code, it goes through a
          fascinating transformation. First, it's translated into assembly code,
          which is a more readable version for computers. Then, it's further
          translated into machine code—instructions that the computer's hardware
          can directly understand. Finally, it becomes a binary executable—the
          ultimate language that our computer loves! Programming is more than
          just automation and data manipulation; it's a versatile skill that
          opens up a world of possibilities. With programming, we can automate
          tasks, manipulate data, build software applications, and much more. It
          requires practice and attention to detail, allowing us to harness the
          power of computers to accomplish various goals.

        <p>
          Here is your first task. You have to learn a general purpose
          programming language. It could be C, C++, Python, Java or JavaScript.
          The aim here is to get familiar with the notion of specific
          instructions and how a computer processes these instructions. My
          recommendation is
          <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/">Harvard's CS50</a> to learn
          C and Python. You can stop watching their lectures once you are
          familiar with Python, Odysseus has a better path for web development
          later down the line.

          If you are looking to start this path with Java, I would recommend
          Code With Mosh. Mosh Hamedani demonstrates his passion for java in his

        </p>

        <p>
          Now that you have a general-purpose programming language under your
          belt, its time to dig deeper.
