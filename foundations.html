      <p>
        In the foundations section, Odysseus will assist you in setting up your
        IDE, which is a coding environment. It will also help you become
        familiar with the command line interface, set up your GitHub account,
        and introduce you to Git, a version control system that aids in managing
        and saving your code. Additionally, this section provides resources to
        help you learn your first programming language and offers ideas for your
        initial project in that language.
      </p>

      <h2 class="element1">Let's setup your work environment.</h2>

      <p>
        In the world of programming, an IDE, which stands for Integrated
        Development Environment, is an essential tool used by every programmer.
        Think of it as a fancy notepad designed specifically for coding. IDEs
        provide programmers with a wide range of powerful tools to write, edit,
        and manage their code efficiently. One of the key features of IDEs is
        syntax highlighting, which visually distinguishes different elements of
        the code by applying color formatting. This makes it easier to read and
        understand the code. Additionally, IDEs often offer auto-formatting
        capabilities, which automatically adjust the code's indentation,
        spacing, and formatting according to predefined rules. This helps in
        maintaining consistent code style and improves code readability.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are several popular IDEs available in the programming community,
        such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Eclipse, IntelliJ, and XCode.
        However, for the purposes of the Odysseus project, the requirement is to
        use Visual Studio Code. You can download VS Code from their
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank"
          >official website&nearr;</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also want to recommend the Prettier extension for VS Code. Prettier is
        a powerful code formatter that automatically formats your code based on
        a set of predefined rules. This can save you time and effort in manually
        formatting your code. If you're interested in setting up Prettier in
        your desktop environment, you can follow
        <a href="https://youtu.be/8k-b-7rJAeU" target="_blank"
          >this tutorial&nearr;</a
        >
        to get started. By using Visual Studio Code as your IDE and installing
        the Prettier extension, you'll have access to a robust coding
        environment along with the added benefit of automated code formatting.
      </p>

      <h2 class="element1">
        Command Line Interface and the Bourne Again SHell (BASH)
      </h2>

      <p>
        Now that you have a clean setup, let's familiarize ourselves with the
        command line, which is an interface you will inevitably use quite often.
        The command line provides a text-based environment where you can
        interact with your computer through typed commands. It allows you to
        navigate your file system, execute programs, manage files and
        directories, and perform various tasks efficiently.
      </p>

      <p>
        To help you get started with the command line, Odysseus recommends
        checking out
        <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/" target="_blank"
          >the Software Carpentry's Unix Shell Document&nearr;</a
        >. This resource provides a comprehensive introduction to the command
        line language. Reading chapters 1-4 will give you a solid foundation,
        specifically focusing on pipers and filters, which are powerful concepts
        for manipulating data and streamlining processes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you are comfortable with the command line basics, Odysseus suggests
        watching
        <a href="https://youtu.be/I4EWvMFj37g" target="_blank"
          >Fireship's Video&nearr;</a
        >
        about BASH (Bourne Again SHell). BASH is a popular shell, or command
        processor, available on many Unix-like systems, including Linux and
        macOS. It not only provides the command line interface but also offers
        additional scripting tools and functionalities. With BASH, you can write
        scripts to automate tasks, create aliases for frequently used commands,
        and customize your shell environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's important to note that the command line interface and BASH are
        closely related but not the same thing. The command line interface is a
        general term referring to the text-based interaction with the computer,
        while BASH specifically refers to a widely used shell that provides this
        interface and extends it with powerful scripting capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        By gaining proficiency in the command line and exploring BASH, you will
        be equipped with efficient tools to navigate, manage, and automate tasks
        in your programming journey.
